Subject: [PATCH 6/9] rockchip: rk3399: enable spl-fifo-mode for sdmmc only
 when needed

Commit 5c606ca35c42 ("rockchip: rk3399: enable spl-fifo-mode for sdmmc")
mentions that the RK3399 SoC can't do DMA between SDMMC and SRAM.
According to the TRM "7.3.2 Embedded SRAM access path" [1], only the
8KB SRAM at 0xff3b0000 (INTMEM1) is in this situation. The 192KB SRAM
can be accessed by both DMA controllers.

Assuming the only use case for writing from MMC to INTMEM1 is loading
a FIT image, and with the introduction of a temporary buffer for that
purpose (CONFIG_SPL_LOAD_FIT_IMAGE_BUFFER_SIZE), spl-fifo-mode is not
needed anymore and DMA can be enabled safely.
